1)How it works?
    1. Server runs as a new thread
    2. In method run() server listen to income connections
    3. For each income Client connection, Server create a new Thread
    4. That client thread call play() and server run client's thread

    5. Play() controlled by two while loops:
        Get response from clients are stmt for loops
        Send request to clients is object (Question or PlayerScore)
    6. After loops - game is over.
    7. Server get last response about saving score
    8. Server send last request with object which contain top10 players
